This repository contains my solutions for the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program** on Forage.

- Created calculated fields to track machine health.
- Built an interactive dashboard showing downtime by factory and device type to answer the following Questions: <br>
   i) In which location did machines break the most ?<br>
   ii) What are the machines that broke most often in that location ?<br>

  The Dashboard:

  - created a new column in Excel to label roles as:<br>
     i) Fair(+-10)<br>
     ii) Unfair (<-10 AND >10)<br>
     ii) Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)<br>
